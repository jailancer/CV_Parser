# NLP-Based CV Parsing Project: An In-depth Exploration of Techniques and Tools: 

The "cv_parser" project represents a meticulous exploration of NLP tools and techniques, offering a comprehensive guide to building a sophisticated resume parser in Python. By incorporating fundamental processes and advanced libraries such as SpaCy and Apache Tika, the project aims to empower users with the skills necessary for robust resume information extraction and analysis.


## NLP Tools and Techniques Used:
### Tokenization

NLP serves as the foundational framework for this project, commencing with the pivotal step of Tokenization. The process involves segmenting textual data into tokens, facilitating subsequent steps in the NLP pipeline. The project underscores the significance of tokenization in determining the weights of words based on their relevance within the corpus.

### Lemmatization

Lemmatization emerges as a critical component in decoding the semantics of text, aiming to convert words into their root forms or 'lemmas.' This process ensures a uniform understanding of the underlying content, irrespective of the specific form of verbs used.

### Parts-of-Speech Tagging

An exploration into Parts-of-Speech (POS) Tagging is paramount in discerning the contextual meaning of words. The project elucidates the implementation of POS Tagging in Python, offering insights into disambiguating terms with multiple meanings.

### Stopwords Elimination

Stopwords Elimination, a preprocessing step, involves the removal of inconsequential words, optimizing processing efficiency. The project delves into the necessity of extracting relevant information from resumes, particularly in cases where applicants present work experiences embedded in lengthy paragraphs replete with stopwords.

### SpaCy

SpaCy, a versatile Python library, emerges as a cornerstone in the project, facilitating the implementation of various NLP techniques. The tutorial provides a comprehensive guide on leveraging SpaCy for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and visualizing entities through its built-in tool, displacy. The project underscores SpaCy's support for rule-based matching, shallow parsing, and dependency parsing.

### OCR using TIKA

The integration of Apache Tika for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) introduces a novel dimension to the project. OCR plays a pivotal role in converting images into text, enabling the extraction of textual information from PDF files. The textual data extracted is subsequently subjected to diverse NLP methodologies to derive meaningful insights.
